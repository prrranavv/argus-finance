# üí∞ Argus Finance - Your Personal Finance Command Center

> **"Take control of your money with the power of AI and beautiful design"**

Stop losing track of your spending across multiple credit cards and bank accounts. Argus Finance is the modern finance dashboard that transforms your messy bank statements into actionable insights - without sending your sensitive data to the cloud.

## üöÄ Why Argus Finance?

**Built by a developer, for people who actually want to understand their money.**

As someone who juggled 5+ credit cards and multiple bank accounts, I was tired of:

```

Open `localhost:3000` and upload your first statement. Watch the magic happen.

## üìß Gmail Integration Setup (Optional)

Argus Finance can automatically extract transaction data from your Gmail messages (bank alerts, payment confirmations, etc.). To enable this feature:

### 1. Google Cloud Console Setup
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the Gmail API:
   - Navigate to "APIs & Services" > "Library"
   - Search for "Gmail API" and click "Enable"

### 2. Configure OAuth Consent Screen (IMPORTANT!)
1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "OAuth consent screen"
2. Choose "External" user type (unless you have a Google Workspace)
3. Fill in the required fields:
   - **App name**: "Argus Finance" (or your app name)
   - **User support email**: Your email address
   - **Developer contact information**: Your email address
4. Add scopes: Click "Add or Remove Scopes" and add:
   - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/gmail.readonly`
5. Add test users: In the "Test users" section, add your Gmail address
6. Save and continue through all steps

### 3. Create OAuth 2.0 Credentials
1. Go to "APIs & Services" > "Credentials"
2. Click "Create credentials" > "OAuth 2.0 Client IDs"
3. Set application type to "Web application"
4. Add authorized redirect URI: `http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/auth`
5. For production, add your domain: `https://yourdomain.com/api/gmail/auth`
6. Save and copy the Client ID and Client Secret

### 4. Get Access Tokens
1. Add your credentials to `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/auth
   ```

2. Start your development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit `http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/auth` to get the authorization URL
4. Follow the authorization flow and copy the returned tokens
5. Add tokens to your `.env.local`:
   ```bash
   GMAIL_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
   ```

### 5. Using Gmail Integration
- Open the Statements modal in the app
- Click "Fetch transactions from Gmail"
- The system will search your last 10 emails for transaction data
- Extracted transactions will appear in the UI for review

**Privacy Note**: The Gmail integration only reads emails from known bank senders and transaction-related subjects. Your email content is processed locally and only transaction data is extracted.

### üîß Troubleshooting Gmail Setup

**Getting "Error 403: access_denied"?**
This happens when the OAuth consent screen isn't properly configured:

1. **Configure OAuth Consent Screen**: Make sure you've completed step 2 above
2. **Add Test User**: Add your Gmail address in the "Test users" section
3. **App Status**: Your app will be in "Testing" mode - this is normal for personal use
4. **Verification**: You don't need to verify your app for personal use

**Common Issues:**
- ‚ùå **Redirect URI mismatch**: Ensure it's exactly `http://localhost:3000/api/gmail/auth`
- ‚ùå **Gmail API not enabled**: Check that Gmail API is enabled in your project
- ‚ùå **Scope missing**: Make sure `gmail.readonly` scope is added to consent screen
- ‚ùå **Not a test user**: Your email must be added as a test user

**Still having issues?** Visit `/api/gmail/auth` in your browser to see detailed error messages and troubleshooting steps.

## üé® Visual Design

**Beautiful by Design**: Argus features a stunning visual identity with:
- **Custom 3D Card Renders**: Your actual credit cards rendered in beautiful 3D

## üí≠ Philosophy

**"Financial tools should be powerful, private, and beautiful."**

Most finance apps are either too simple (mint) or too complex (YNAB). They're built for the masses, not for people who actually care about their financial data.

Argus Finance is different. It's built for:
- **Power users** who want granular control
- **Privacy advocates** who don't trust cloud services
- **Design lovers** who refuse to use ugly software
- **Data enthusiasts** who want their financial data to tell a story

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a passion project, but contributions are welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving the design - let's build something amazing together.

## üìÑ License

MIT License - because good financial tools should be accessible to everyone.
