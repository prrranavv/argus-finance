# üí∞ Argus Finance - Your Personal Finance Command Center

> **"Take control of your money with the power of AI and beautiful design"**

## üöÄ Why Argus Finance?

**Built by a developer, for people who actually want to understand their money.**

As someone who juggled 5+ credit cards and multiple bank accounts, I was tired of:
- üí∏ Losing track of spending across different cards
- üìä Ugly, outdated finance apps that feel like spreadsheets
- üîí Having to upload sensitive financial data to random cloud services

## üí≠ Philosophy

**"Financial tools should be powerful, private, and beautiful."**

Most finance apps are either too simple (mint) or too complex (YNAB). They're built for the masses, not for people who actually care about their financial data.

Argus Finance is different. It's built for:
- **Power users** who want granular control
- **Privacy advocates** who don't trust cloud services
- **Design lovers** who refuse to use ugly software
- **Data enthusiasts** who want their financial data to tell a story

## ü§ù Contributing

This is a passion project, but contributions are welcome! Whether you're fixing bugs, adding features, or improving the design - let's build something amazing together.

## üìÑ License

MIT License - because good financial tools should be accessible to everyone.
